A credit card fraud detection system using machine learning aims to identify fraudulent transactions among a large number of legitimate ones. Logistic regression is a popular algorithm for this task due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in binary classification problems.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The goal of the project is to build a machine learning model that can classify credit card transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. The model is trained on historical transaction data, which includes both types of transactions, with the aim of predicting the likelihood of fraud in future transactions.
